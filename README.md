## 🚀 Projects

### 1. CallBridge
A mobile app that enables d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing users to make phone calls independently using real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology.

During a call, incoming speech is transcribed live for the user to read, while typed responses are converted into spoken audio for the call recipient, helping users communicate confidently with businesses, government services, emergency hotlines, and personal contacts.

Deployed on the **iOS App Store** and **Google Play Store**

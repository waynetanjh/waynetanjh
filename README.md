# Projects I am working on 

1) CallBridge

CallBridge is a mobile app that enables d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing users to make phone calls independently using real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology that is launched on the ios App Store and Google Play Store in Singapore. 

During a call, incoming speech is transcribed live for the user to read, while typed responses are converted into spoken audio for the call recipient, helping users communicate confidently with businesses, government services, emergency hotlines, and personal contacts.
